# Karting-Microgame-Game-Build
A game I enhanced for my "Game Design" 1st year module.

The assessment required the Unity Karting micrograme to be built upon with 1 power-up and 1 hazard.
I designed and coded the power-up and the hazard, represented by green and red primitives.
All assets came with the microgame, which I used to design a course to showcase my additions.

The power-up, represented by a green sphere, makes the player "invulnerable" for 5 seconds, allowing
them to pass through all obstacles.
The hazard, represented by red cuboids, makes the player invisble for 5 seconds, meaning they must 
use only the camera position and engine smoke to guid them.
I also removed the barriers from the track, and coded a game fail conidition for falling off the map.
